Discord bot for table top rpg

3 parts:
1) Discord bot with standard commands
2) Live streaming audio from one channel to another with reduced volume
3) Determine the position of the players on a board

=> Use the position of the players on a board to move them in different voice channels:
- near = can hear and talk to each other
- mid distance = can hear the conversation at 50% volume but cannot participate
- far = don't hear anything and cannot be heard
